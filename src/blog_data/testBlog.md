# First Blog || Test blog

## First Paragraph
Nothing much, just a test blog to make sure everything is working as expected.

```python
class Bhaskar(Person):
    def say_hello(self):
        print("Hi!! My name is Bhaskar Neupane.")
    
    def introduce(self):
        print("I have been working with Python Programming language for few years now.")


bhaskar = Bhaskar()
bhaskar.say_hello()
bhaskar.introduce()
```
